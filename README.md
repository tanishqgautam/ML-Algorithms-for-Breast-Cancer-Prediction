# AIM   
The goal of this notebook is the application of several machine learning techniques to classify whether the tumor mass is benign or malignant in women residing in the state of Wisconsin, USA. This will help in understanding the important underlaying importance of attributes thereby helping in predicting the stage of breast cancer depending on the values of these attributes.
